Hello dear all,


Good morning! My name is Jingqi Liu (Jessie) and I’m a new intern at GS/OSD11 & PSD11 starting from last week. 

I did my bachelor in engineering at Tsinghua University in China, and is now a master student majored in business analytics at EPFL. I speak English and Chinese, with German still in practice. 

In the next 6 months I’ll be supporting the LDC FR project and is happy to help with any other tasks you have. I’m looking forward to meeting more of you and having enjoyable teamwork together.

Have a nice week.
